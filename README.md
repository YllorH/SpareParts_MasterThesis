Master Thesis - Data Science and Marketing Analytics at ESE - Spare Parts demand forecasting
Forecasting the demands of spare parts, using 9 different methods on 8 data sets (industrial and simulated).
The methuds used are:
  * Statistical methods:
      - Croston
      - SBA
      - DLP
  * Machine Learning methods:
      - MLP
      - LSTM
      - LightGBM
      - RF
  * Non-parametrical methods:
      - Willemain
      - Quantile regression

The raw data with full information can be found in the folder "All Data sets", which consists of four industrial and four simulated data sets. The irrelevant information (to the code) is removed in "RawData.RData", and this is used as the R environment for the R script "Cleaning_Description_Classification".
